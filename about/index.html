        The Hyderabad Public School is a co-educational, day & residential school in Hyderabad. One of the
        oldest educational institutions in the country in the youngest state of the country – it is this range
        that best defines The Hyderabad Public School.

        <br />In 1919, a proposal was presented to the Seventh Nizam, H.E.H. Mir Osman Ali Khan by the Hon’ble
        H. Weikfield, Director General of the Court of Wards (Department of Revenue) to establish a fully
        residential school on the lines of Eton College, London, to give the sons of Jagirdars an enriching
        learning experience.

        <br />In 1923, the Jagirdar’s College opened its doors to five students and six teachers under the first
        Founder-Principal Mr.H.W.Shawcross. The first batch appeared for Senior Cambridge ‘O’ levels in 1929. By
        1930, the strength of the School had risen to 150.

        <h5><span style="user-select: none">1.</span> Nagarjuna </h5>
        <p>
          Named after the notable Buddhist philosopher – Nagarjuna (c.150 – c.250 CE)

          Nagarjuna and his disciple Aryadeva are considered to be the founders of the Madhyamaka school of Mahayana
          Buddhism. Scholars believe that Nagarjuna was an advisor to the king Yajna Sri Satakarni of the Satavahana
          dynasty.

          Nagarjuna House believes in striving for the holistic development of its students. We work hard towards being
          the best in sports and co-curricular activities. We proudly held the Marching Shield for four consecutive
          years, as well as winning the Over-All Shield consistently.

          Named after the incredible South Indian dynastic empire, based in the Deccan.

          The Vijayanagara kingdom was founded by Harihara and Bukka of the Sangama dynasty in 1336. The empire
          celebrates a strong legacy of monuments spread over South India, most of which are in Hampi. It was a fruitful
          time in our history with fine arts and literature reaching new heights in Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, and
          Sanskrit. The economy, too, flourished.

          The core value of Vijayanagar House is to strive for excellence in every endeavour. All students are
          encouraged to express themselves, and participate in inter-house activities.
